## Installation
The application can be installed via my github repository https://github.com/maryamc/ReadMeForYou.git . Navigate to the repository, copy the SSH key, and then git clone that SSH key into your vscode and workspace of choice.

## Usage
The usage of this application is to allow the user to create a nice and clean README.md for their future projects. Its a nice and simple way for the user to let others know what is going on in their applications. By using this command line application, the format is already set up, so all the user has to do is just type away!

## Instructions
To test the functionality of this application, once the repo has been cloned, the user must cd into the repo, ls to make sure theyre in the correct repo, navigate to index.js. Once in index.js the user must run the command 'node index.js' and answer all of the input prompts. Once complete, "success!" should be logged in the command line and the README.md will be visible in the repo.
